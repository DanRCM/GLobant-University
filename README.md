# GLobant-University

This project focuses on creating a system to track university classes, teachers, and students. Globant University manages a list of teachers, students, and classes, and provides key functionalities for effective tracking.

# Features
Full-Time and Part-Time Teachers: Each teacher can be either full-time or part-time. A teacher's salary is calculated differently based on their type.

Classes: Each class has a name, an assigned classroom, a list of students, and a teacher. Class details can be explored through the system.

Students: Each student is characterized by their name, identification, and age. The system allows the creation of new students and their inclusion in existing classes.

Getting Started
Initialize the system with at least 2 teachers of each type (full-time, part-time).

Create at least 6 different students.

Add at least 4 different classes, assigning a teacher and relevant students to each.

Run the program and explore the following menu options:
a. Display all teachers with their data.
b. Display all classes and select one to view details, including the teacher and students.
c. Create a new student and add them to an existing class.
d. Create a new class and add an existing teacher, existing students, and other relevant data.
e. List all classes in which a specific student is enrolled (search by identification).
f. Exit the program.

# Using the Code
This project has been developed using Java and follows the Model-View-Controller (MVC) pattern to maintain an organized and modular structure. The main classes are organized into three packages: model, controller, and view. You can refer to the detailed implementation in these packages.
